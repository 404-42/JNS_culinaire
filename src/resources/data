iPreheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.
iToss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and black pepper.
iHeat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole.
iFry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside.
iRepeat with the remaining oil and beef.
iReturn the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and mustard, and season well with salt and pepper.
iCover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours.
iRemove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool.
iRemove the thyme.
iWhen the beef is cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
iTransfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top.
iBrush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg.
iTrim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.
iFor the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender.
iDrain and toss with the butter, then season with black pepper.
iTo serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside.

iSeason the beef cubes with salt and black pepper.
iHeat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat.
iDo this in three batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over.
iAdd extra oil if the pan seems dry.
iIn the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds.
iAdd the bacon and fry until slightly browned.
iTransfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs.
iPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
iPour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
iPour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock.
iCover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1½-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced.
iSkim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste.
iPut the casserole dish on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened.
iLeave to cool.
iIncrease the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
iTo make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl.
iGrate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches.
iGradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together.
iKnead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid.
iRoll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than the dish you’re using.
iLine the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well.
iBrush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg.
iRoll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife.
iBrush with beaten egg to glaze.
iPut the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.

iHeat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat.
iSeason the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary.
iDo this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.
iIn the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned.
iMix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture.
iThis enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew.
iThen return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.
iPour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered.
iBring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour.
iHeat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2.
iMake a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil.
iThen cook for 3 hrs.
iIf the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
iCook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.
iTo make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes.
iHeat the olive oil in a large frying pan.
iTip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden.
iSeason well with salt and pepper.
iStir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac.
iTurn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.
iAfter 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated.
iDrain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods.
iLightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste.
iSpoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top.
iGarnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.

nBeef Brisket Pot Roast
cBeef
d52812
i1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want.
iIf there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them.
iLarge pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.
iUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart.
iSlice through the fat, not the beef.
iRepeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.
iSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
i2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.
iPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat.
iCook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned.
i(If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium.
iYou want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.
iTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.
i3 Sauté the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside.
iThere should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.
iAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high.
iSprinkle a little salt on the onions.
iSauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes.
iStir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.
i4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300°F.
iUse kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.
iMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside.
iAdd the beef stock and the tied-up herbs.
iBring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.
iCover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours.
iCarefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.
i5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots.
iCover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.
i6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board.
iCover it with foil.
iPull out and discard the herbs.
i7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options.
iYou can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions.
iIf you serve as is, skip this step.
iTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil.
iPour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth.
iIf you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix.
iPut into a small pot and keep warm.
i8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast.
iThis is the "grain" of the meat.
iSlice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.
iServe with the onions, carrots and gravy.
iServe with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.

iAfter two hours, remove the lid from the stew and place the balls on top of the stew.
iCover, return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until the dumplings have swollen and are tender.
i(If you prefer your dumplings with a golden top, leave the lid off when returning to the oven.
iTo serve, place a spoonful of mashed potato onto each of four serving plates and top with the stew and dumplings.
iSprinkle with chopped parsley.

iNow take some of the soup from meat and add to the top of the bread pieces in baking dish to saturate.
iAdd cooked rice on top of bread pieces.
iSlowly spoon remainder of soup onto rice, looking at glass dish sides to see level of soup, should reach just to top of rice, don’t worry, this doesn’t have to be exact.
iNow you’re ready to make the sauce and fry the meat to put on top.
iTo prepare red sauce: In a pan, add a little oil or butter, crushed tomato, a half teaspoon of tomato paste, salt & pepper, 2 cloves of fresh crushed garlic and cumin.
iAdd also approximately 3 tablespoons of vinegar, stir this until you smell aroma and it is a bit smooth.
iIt should be a bit thick, not watery, but if too thick you can add a bit of water.
iSpread with a wooden spoon atop the rice to cover.
iTo fry meat: In a pan add a bit of butter or oil, the meat, just a touch of tomato paste, about a tablespoon of fresh crushed garlic, salt & pepper, a teaspoon of cumin.

iTo a large bowl, add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly.
iRub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour.
iPour in 1/2 cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together.
iKeep adding ice water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough.
iAt this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it.
iAlternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling.
iAdd ground beef to a large bowl.
iSprinkle in allspice and black pepper.
iMix together and set aside.
iHeat oil in a skillet until hot.
iAdd onions and sauté until translucent.
iAdd hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sauté for another minute.
iAdd 1/4 teaspoon salt.
iAdd seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink.
iAdd ketchup and more salt to taste.
iPour in 2 cups of water and stir.
iBring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce.
iFold in green onions.
iRemove from heat and let cool completely.
iBeat the egg and water together to make an egg wash.
iSet aside.
iNow you can prepare the dough in two ways.
iFirst Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin.
iIf you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle.
iTake a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles.
iPlace about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1/2 of each circle.
iDip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry.
iFold over the other half and press to seal.
iTake a fork and crimp the edges.
iCut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform.
iPlace on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.
iSecond Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time.
iRoll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger.
iDon’t worry if the edges are not perfect.
iPlace 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle.
iDip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry.
iFold over the other half and press to seal.
iTake a fork and crimp the edges.
iCut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform.
iPlace on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.
iAfter forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350 F.
iJust before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash.
iBake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
iCool on wire racks.
iServe warm.

iWash and rinse the dried kidney beans.

ithen cover with water in a deep bowl.
iRemember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl.
iSoak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker.
iI tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job.
iHave your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife.
iWash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil.
iCook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water).
iThe goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in.
iTime to start the soup.
iPlace everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil.
iAs it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard.
iReduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.
i.
ibasically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.
iIt’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.
iNow is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings.
iMix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough.
iallow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape.
iAdd them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil.
iYou’ll notice that I didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish.
iHowever you can taste and adjust accordingly.
iLets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused.
iCook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes.
iKeep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.
iWhile this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.
iA hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue).
iYou can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.

iTake a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it.
iOnce the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown.
iThen take them out on a plate and set aside.
iTo the same pot, add the chopped garlic and sauté for a minute.
iThen add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft.
iThis would take about 5 minutes.
iThen return the fried onion to the pot and stir.
iAdd ginger paste and sauté well.
iNow add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies.
iGive them a quick stir.
iNext goes in the spices – turmeric powder and red chilli powder.
iSauté the spices well for couple of minutes.
iAdd the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through.
iThis would take about 15 minutes.
iSlowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.
iWhen the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn’t split.
iSprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves.
iMix well.
iFinally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.
iSprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with naan or rotis.

nJerk chicken with rice & peas
cChicken
d52937
iTo make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée.
iIf you’re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again.
iEventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.
iTaste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty.
iYou can now throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you.
iIf it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced.
iMake a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices.
iCover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.
iIf you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook.
iAuthentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled.
iTo get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins.
iTo cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
iPut the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through.
iWhile the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas.
iRinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans.
iSeason with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat.
iOnce the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.
iAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid.
iLeave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed.
iSqueeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.

nPotato Gratin with Chicken
cChicken
d52780
i15 minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn't have to take 45mins, it's nice for a change and you can control the calorie content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche.
i(It's always tastes better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 mins till firmish, not soft.
iFinely slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml of chicken stock.
iCook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and pour onto the onions.
iSeason and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all is covered but not swimming.
iGrate Parmesan over the top then finish under the grill till nicely golden.
iserve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.

iBring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot; stir in chicken breasts, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 20 minutes.
iRemove from heat.
iRemove chicken breasts to a plate using a slotted spoon; reserve broth.
iJuice potatoes with an electric juicer; place dry potato flesh into a bowl and discard juice.
iStir salt and pepper into potatoes; stir in enough reserved broth to make the mixture the consistency of oatmeal.
iSet remaining broth aside.
iSpread half of potato mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
iLay cooked chicken breast evenly over potatoes; scatter caramelized onion evenly over chicken.

iYou should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat.
iBut if you are worried then oil your hotplate/grill.
iPlace chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time).
iRemove chicken from the grill and cover loosely with foil.
iSet aside to rest for 5 minutes.
iSlice chicken and pile onto platter alongside flatbreads, Salad and the Yoghurt Sauce.

iDrain and put to one side.
iIn a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil until very hot, then drop in the garlic and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds.
iDon’t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste.
iSpoon in the curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours.
iNext, pour in the coconut milk and let it come to a bubble.
iStir in the fish sauce and sugar, then the pieces of chicken.
iTurn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.
iTip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add a lovely citrussy flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves (or lime zest).
iThe basil leaves go in next, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness.
iScatter with the lime garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.

iHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base).
iTo make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl.
iBeat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly.
iScrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean.
iCool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.
iFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above.
iMix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract.
iFold in some pink food colouring.
iThen scrape it all into the tin and bake as before.
iCool.
iTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve.
iBarely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge.
iRoughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height.
iDiscard or nibble leftover sponge.
iRepeat with pink cake.
iTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length.
iRoll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.
i5cm thick.
iBrush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end.
iBrush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect.
iTrim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.
iCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side.
iTrim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork).
iIf you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.
iAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.
iCan be frozen for up to a month.

iFor the biscuits, preheat the oven to 200C/180C (fan)/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking parchment.
iScatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown.
iWatch them carefully so that they don’t have a chance to burn.
iRemove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool.
iPut the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy.
iRoughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder.
iStir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball – you may need to use your hands.
iDivide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls.
iPlace the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading.
iPress the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/½in thick.
iBake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown.
iLeave to cool on the trays.
iThey will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool.
iStore in an airtight tin and eat within five days.
iFor the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt.
iPut the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar.
iStir in the lemon juice and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices.
iRemove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest.
iSimmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy.
iRemove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible.
iLeave the purée to cool and discard the seeds.
iYou should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée.
iPut the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don’t take it too far.
iWhen the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed.
iPour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined.
iSpoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes – or one large, single bowl.
iIt should look quite marbled, so don’t over-stir it.
iScatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries.
iSprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.

iFirst, make the pastry.
iTip the ingredients into a food processor with 1 /4 tsp salt.
iBlend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
iDrizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start to clump together.
iTip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball.
iPat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 mins.
iHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.
iRemove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 5 mins to soften.
iFlour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin.
iUse the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin – mine was about 3cm deep.
iPress the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps.
iLeave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later).
iLine with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans.
iBlind-bake for 15-20 mins until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 mins until golden brown.
iTrim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small serrated knife is best for this.
iIf there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps.
iMeanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt.
iHeat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth.
iRemove from the heat and cool for 10 mins.
iReduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.
iBeat the eggs in a bowl.
iAdd the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined.
iPour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips.
iBake on the middle shelf for 50-55 mins until set.
iRemove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hrs before serving.

i1. Blend all the mousse ingredients together in your food processor until smooth.
iAdd the cacao powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to hand in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas varies so much.
iThe perfect ratio in order to avoid the dish tasting too much of either is to use equal amounts of both.
i2. Taste and add a few drops of stevia if you feel you need more sweetness.
i3. Fill little cups or shot glasses with the mousse, sprinkle with the cacao powder or nibs and serve.
iTip If you don’t have a frozen banana to hand you can just use a normal one and then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert.

iMix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl.
iHolding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together.
iRepeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins – the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir.
iAsk the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish.
iGenerously butter two 1.

iPack in the pudding mixture.
iCover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying).
iTrim off any excess paper.
iNow stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight).
iTie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan.
iWatch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly.
iBoil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary.
iRemove from the pans and leave to cool overnight.

iTo make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar.
iGradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger.
iPut in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set.
iThe butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks.

iRoll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.
iTo make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan.
iTake it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.
iTo make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across.
iRe-roll the trimming if needed.
iPlace a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3).
iFlip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round.

iPull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in.
iHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
iTear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm).
iSit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it.
iTip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor; pulse until the butter has disappeared.
iTip into a mixing bowl.
iStir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough.
iYou may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour.
iTip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm.
iSpread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge.
iPinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too.
iCarefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal.
iThe roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don’t wrap it tightly.
iLift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr.
iLet the pudding sit for 5 mins before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.

iFor the crust, melt the butter in a medium pan.
iStir in the biscuit crumbs and sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened.
iPress the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes.
iCool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.
iFor the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 200C/conventional 240C/gas 9.

iContinue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest).
iWhisk to blend, but don't over-beat.
iThe batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.
iBrush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet.
iPour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible.
iBake for 10 minutes.
iReduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more.
iIf you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble.

i1) Blitz the biscuits and the pretzels in a food processor and mix the biscuits with the melted butter.
iSpread on the bottom of an 8″/20cm Deep Springform Tin and press down firmly.
i3) Pour in the double cream & Salt flakes and continue to whisk for a couple of minutes until its very thick and mousse like (I mix it on a medium speed, level 6/10) – Now this could take up to 5 minutes depending on your mixer, but you seriously have to stick at it – it will hold itself completely when finished mixing (like a meringue does!) If you don’t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don’t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that’ll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight.

iStone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over.
iLeave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork.
iStir in the vanilla extract.
iButter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet.
iHeat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
iWhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings.
iMix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl.
iBeat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar).
iAdd the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions.
iBeat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat.
iRepeat until all the flour and milk is used.
iStir the soaked dates into the pudding batter.
iThe mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter.
iSpoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.
iMeanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream.
iBring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved.
iStir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn.
iTake the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.
iRemove the puddings from the oven.
iLeave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out.
iYou can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce.
iTo do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes.
iSit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them.
iCover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill).
iWhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
iWarm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling.

iIf necessary, add more water.
iDo not process more than 30 seconds.
iTurn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball.
iDivide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using.
iThis will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour.
iAfter the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.
iRoll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle.
i(To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).
i)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan.
iBrush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.
i5 cm).
iRefrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling.
iRemove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle.
iUsing a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips.
iPlace the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
iMake the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl.
iIn a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon.
iRemove the chilled pie crust from the fridge.
iSprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust.
iAdd the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine.
iPour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell.
iSprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.
iRemove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.
i5 cm) apart, on top of the filling.
i(Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.
i) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry.
iTake another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry.
iUnfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time.
iLay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips.
iTrim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.
i5 cm) overhang.
iSeal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry.
iBrush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar.
iCover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.
iPut a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.
iPlace the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring.
iContinue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.
iRemove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours.
iServe at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
iLeftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
iReheat before serving.
iThis pie can be frozen.

iFirst make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor).
iAdd about three tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.
iPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up.
iGrease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter.
iRemove about 150g/5½oz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.
iRoll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry.
iPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking.
iPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly.
iEgg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about).
iDo not cut into strips at this stage.
iDo not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture.
iTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.
iOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup.
i(You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.
i) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.
iPour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.
iRemove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide.
iMake sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.
iEgg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.
iOnce the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.
iBake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
iIf at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil.
iBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.
iRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin.

iUse pickled vine leaves here, preserved in brine.
iSmall delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling.
iAnd remove any stalks.
iDrain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use.
iBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment.
iCouscous is great, too.
iServes four.
iFirst make the filling.
iPut all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl.
iCut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins.
iAdd half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir.
iLeave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day.
iBefore using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.
iTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan.
iAdd the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar.
iSeason, and simmer for 20 minutes.
iWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves.
iUse any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan.
iTrim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.
i5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.
iLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up.
iPut two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip.
iFold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape.
iPlace in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).
iPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover).
iPlace a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid.
iBring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes.
iMost of the liquid should evaporate.
iRemove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm.
iWhen serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great.
iServe a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice.
iSpoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.

iBrush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes (put a tray on the shelf below to catch any drips).
iThen reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/Gas 3 and cook for a further 1¼ hours until golden-brown.
iLeave to cool completely before refrigerating for two hours, or overnight.
iRun a knife around the edge of the pie, remove from the tin and serve with chutneys, salads or pickles.

iThe day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish.
iLay the duck legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs.
iCover the duck and refrigerate overnight.
iThis can be done up to 2 days ahead.
iPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer.
iBrush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine.
iCover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
iAs soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering.
i(If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.
i) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded.
iLeave to cool.
iThe duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp.
iIf you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan.
iCover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months.
iThe liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.
iTo reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.
iRemove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
iRoast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp.

iGet everything ready.
iWarm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan on a medium heat.
iCrack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg.
iWith the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan.
iIt should bubble and sizzle, but not brown.
iSeason the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.
iLet the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre.
iLeave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked.
iLeave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left.
iWith the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture.
iIt should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top.
iA quick burst of heat will brown the underside.
iGrip the handle underneath.
iTilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge.
iFold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier.
iFor a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers.
iRub the other knob of butter over to glaze.
iServe immediately.

iAdd the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.
iThe braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat.
iCover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch.
iCover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer.
iCheck the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees.
iContinue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.
iThe gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl.
iCover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.
iThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata.
iReturn the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.
iUsing a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact.
iThe shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky.
iBut if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all.
iArrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.
iFinishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it.
iTaste the sauce for concentration of flavor.
iIf it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes.
iTaste again for salt and pepper.
iIf the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.
iPortioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person.
iIf the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts.
iBe sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.
iServing: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving.
iJust before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.

i1. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil.
iAdd the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions.
iThe pasta should be tender but still chewy.
i2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
i3. Drain the pasta in a colander.
iPlace the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter.
iWhen the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute.
iWatch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan.
i4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined.
iCook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.
iRemove from the heat.
iGradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce.
iThen stir in the drained cooked pasta.
i5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
iCoat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter.
iPour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula.
iCoat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese.
iRefrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.
i6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
i7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.
i8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper.
iCarefully cut into 8 equal pieces.
iEach piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich.
i(You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.
i9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice.
iPlace half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board.
iTop each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese.
i(Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.
i) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each.
iFinish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.
i10.
iUsing a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it.
iCover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes.
iTurn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.

iBefore you start, put your oven on its lowest setting, ready to keep things warm.
iPeel the potatoes, grate 2 of them, then set aside.
iCut the other 2 into large chunks, then boil for 10-15 mins or until tender.
iMeanwhile, squeeze as much of the liquid from the grated potatoes as you can using a clean tea towel.
iMash the boiled potatoes, then mix with the grated potato, spring onions and flour.
iWhisk the egg white in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks.
iFold in the buttermilk, then add the bicarbonate of soda.
iFold into the potato mix.
iHeat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then add 1 tbsp butter and some of the oil.
iDrop 3-4 spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the pan, then gently cook for 3-5 mins on each side until golden and crusty.
iKeep warm on a plate in the oven while you cook the next batch, adding more butter and oil to the pan before you do so.
iYou will get 16 crumpet-size boxty from the mix.
iCan be made the day ahead, drained on kitchen paper, then reheated in a low oven for 20 mins.
iHeat the grill to medium and put the tomatoes in a heavy-based pan.
iAdd a good knob of butter and a little oil, then fry for about 5 mins until softened.
iGrill the bacon, then pile onto a plate and keep warm.

iPreheat the oven to 350°.
iRemove the stems from one bunch of Tuscan kale and tear the leaves into 1" pieces (mustard greens, collards, spinach, and chard are great, too).
iCoarsely chop half a head of green cabbage.
iCombine the greens in a large baking dish and add 4 cloves of thinly sliced garlic.
iAdding some sliced onions and shiitake mushrooms at this point is optional, but highly recommended (I'll sauté the onions and mushrooms in a cast iron baking dish right on the stove before adding to the greens).
iCoat the greens with some olive oil and pour ½ cup chicken stock or broth over everything.
iCover the dish with foil and bake until the greens are wilted, about 15 minutes.
iRemove foil and season with salt and pepper.
iContinue to bake until cabbage is tender, about 20-25 minutes more.
iMeanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high.
iPrick four sweet Italian sausages with a fork and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
iWhen the greens are done, slice the sausage and toss into the greens with a splash of your favorite vinegar (I like sherry or red wine).

iKeep warm over a low heat.
iReheat the pan you used to cook the cabbage (no need to wash first), add a splash of oil, crack in the eggs and fry to your liking.

iCut the tenderloins into 5 equal-size pieces leaving the tail ends a little longer.
iTake a clear plastic bag and slip one of the pieces in.
iBash it into an escalope the size of a side-plate with a rolling pin and repeat with the remaining pieces.
iPut the wine, paprika, some salt and pepper and the juice of ½ a lemon in a bowl and add the pork.
iLeave to marinate for 20-30 minutes, while you get your barbecue to the stage where the coals are glowing but there are no flames.
iTo make the chips, fill a basin with cool water and cut the potatoes into 3cm-thick chips.
iSoak them in the water for 5 minutes and then change the water.
iLeave for 5 more minutes.
iDrain and then pat dry on a towel or with kitchen paper.
iHeat the oil in a deep fryer or a deep heavy-based pan with a lid to 130C and lower the chips into the oil (in batches).
iBlanch for 8-10 minutes.
iRemove from the oil and drain well.
iPlace on a tray to cool.
iReheat the oil to 180C (make sure it’s hot or your chips will be soggy) and lower the basket of chips into the oil (again, do this in batches).
iLeave to cook for 2 minutes and then give them a little shake.
iCook for another minute or so until they are well coloured and crisp to the touch.
iDrain well for a few minutes, tip into a bowl and sprinkle with sea salt.
iThe pork will cook quickly so do it in 2 batches.
iTake the pieces out of the marinade, rub them with oil, and drop them onto the barbecue (you could also use a chargrill).
iCook for 1 minute on each side – they may flare up as you do so.
iThis should really be enough time as they will keep on cooking.
iTake them off the barbecue and pile onto a plate.
iRepeat with the remaining batch.
iServe by piling a plate with chips, drop the pork on top of each pile and pouring the juices from the plate over so the chips take up the flavours.
iTop with a spoon of mayonnaise and a wedge of lemon.

iOnce bashed, use your hands to reshape the meat to its original shape and thickness – this step will ensure the meat is as succulent as possible.
iPut the flour, eggs and panko breadcrumbs into three separate wide-rimmed bowls.
iSeason the meat, then dip first in the flour, followed by the eggs, then the breadcrumbs.
iIn a large frying or sauté pan, add enough oil to come 2cm up the side of the pan.
iHeat the oil to 180C – if you don’t have a thermometer, drop a bit of panko into the oil and if it sinks a little then starts to fry, the oil is ready.
iAdd two pork chops and cook for 1 min 30 secs on each side, then remove and leave to rest on a wire rack for 5 mins.

nFul Medames
cVegetarian
d53025
iAs the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve.
iCook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened.
iThey take 2–2 1/2 hours of gentle simmering.
iWhen the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce.
iIt is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans.
iThis is to thicken the sauce.
iServe the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.
iPass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.
iThe beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing.
iPeel hard-boiled eggs—1 per person—to cut up in the bowl with the beans.
iTop the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions.
iOtherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomatoes and cucumbers cut into sticks.
iServe with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onions soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes.
iAnother way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464).
iIn Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers.
iA traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking.
iIn Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.

cVegetarian

iBegin by roasting the squash.
iSlice it into thin crescents and drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle with sea salt.
iI added a fresh little sage I had in the fridge, but it’s unnecessary.
iRoast the squash a 205 C (400 F) for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until soft and golden.
iLet cool and chop into cubes.
iMeanwhile, rinse the lentils and cover them with water.
iBring them to the boil then turn down to a simmer and let cook (uncovered) for 20-30 minutes, or until tender.
iDrain and set aside.
iWhile the lentils are cooking heat the 1 Tbsp.
iof oil on low in a medium pot.
iAdd the onions and leeks and sauté for 5 or so minutes, or until they begin to soften.
iAdd the garlic next along with the cumin and coriander, cooking for a few more minutes.
iAdd the remaining spices – paprika, cinnamon, chilli, cocoa, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and oregano.
iNext add the can of tomatoes, the water or stock, and carrots.
iLet simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture has thickened up.
iYou’ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed.
iAdd the lentils and chopped roasted squash.
iLet cook for 10 more minutes to heat through.
iServe with sliced jalapeno, lime wedges, cilantro, green onions, and cashew sour cream.
i1 tsp.
iBring some water to the boil, and use it to soak the cashews for at least four hours.
iAlternatively, you can use cold water and let the cashews soak overnight, but I’m forgetful/lazy, so often use the boil method which is much faster.
iAfter the cashews have soaked, drain them and add to a high speed blender.
iBegin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached.
iYou may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency.
iAdd a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).

iTo turn it over, slide it onto a plate and put another plate on top, turn the whole thing over and slide it back into the pan to finish cooking.
iOnce cooked, transfer to a plate and serve the tortilla warm or cold, scattered with the chopped parsley.
iTo accompany, take slices of warmed baguette, stab all over with a fork and rub with the remaining garlic, pile on grated tomatoes and season with sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil.

iHeat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.
iCook the sausages first.
iAdd the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden.
iAfter the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients.
iIf you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.
iSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon.
iPlace the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached.
iLike the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.
iFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top.
iSeason with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil.
iPlace stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes.
iAvoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.
iFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'.
iSeason with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil.
iPlace cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes.
iGently turn over and season again.
iCook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.
iFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin.
iPlace on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.
iFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan.
iIdeally, use bread that is a couple of days old.
iHeat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil.
iAdd the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden.
iIf the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil.
iFor a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.
iFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds.
iAdd a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted.
iCook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.
iOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.

iPreheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
iIn a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined.
iLightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten.
iCut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares.
iOn the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge.
iNOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends.
iYour pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact.
iTake the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner.
iYou will now have a diamond shape.
iPlace 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top.
iRepeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet.
iBake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed.

iHeat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.
iCook the sausages first.
iAdd the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden.
iAfter the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients.
iIf you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.
iSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon.
iPlace the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached.
iLike the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.
iFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top.
iSeason with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil.
iPlace stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes.
iAvoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.
iFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'.
iSeason with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil.
iPlace cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes.
iGently turn over and season again.
iCook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.
iFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin.
iPlace on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.
iFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan.
iIdeally, use bread that is a couple of days old.
iHeat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil.
iAdd the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden.
iIf the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil.
iFor a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.
iFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds.
iAdd a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted.
iCook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.
iOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.

nHome-made Mandazi
cBreakfast
d52967
iThis is one recipe a lot of people have requested and I have tried to make it as simple as possible and I hope it will work for you.
iMake sure you use the right flour which is basically one with raising agents.
iAdjust the amount of sugar to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever you have them.
iYou can use Coconut milk instead of regular milk, you can also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered cloves or cinnamon.
iFor “healthy looking” mandazis do not roll the dough too thin before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above.
i1. Mix the flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl.
i3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough.
i4. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have a smooth surface.
i5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth  and allow to rest for 15 minutes.
i6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm thick piece.
i7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired size setting aside ready for deep frying.
i8. Heat your oil in a suitable pot and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first side then turn to cook on the second side.

iFirst make the Hollandaise sauce.
iPut the lemon juice and vinegar in a small bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk with a balloon whisk until light and frothy.
iPlace the bowl over a pan of simmering water and whisk until mixture thickens.
iGradually add the butter, whisking constantly until thick – if it looks like it might be splitting, then whisk off the heat for a few mins.
iSeason and keep warm.
iTo poach the eggs, bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar.
iLower the heat so that the water is simmering gently.
iStir the water so you have a slight whirlpool, then slide in the eggs one by one.
iCook each for about 4 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.
iLightly toast and butter the muffins, then put a couple of slices of salmon on each half.
iTop each with an egg, spoon over some Hollandaise and garnish with chopped chives.

iPour in 1 litre chicken or fish stock, add ½ teaspoon salt and bring to the boil, stir once to release any rice from the bottom of the pan.
iCover with a close-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low and leave to cook very gently for 12 minutes.
iMeanwhile, bring some water to the boil in a large shallow pan.
iAdd 750g un-dyed smoked haddock fillet and simmer for 4 minutes, until the fish is just cooked.
iLift it out onto a plate and leave until cool enough to handle.
iHard-boil 3 eggs for 8 minutes.
iFlake the fish, discarding any skin and bones.
iDrain the eggs, cool slightly, then peel and chop.

iGently fork in the fish and the chopped eggs, cover again and return to the heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the fish has heated through.
iGently stir in almost all the 3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, and season with a little salt and black pepper to taste.
iServe scattered with the remaining parsley and garnished with 1 lemon, cut into wedges.
